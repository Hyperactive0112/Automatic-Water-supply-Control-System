        The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) changes human’s life into a smart world.Physical objects connected with smart sensors provide data to make people's life easier. We
present a case study of the smart water dispenser is with the aid of Flow sensor, solenoid valve,and relay is built to assists the users and the water suppliers by tracking the amount of water used
in day to day activity. The smart water dispenser measures the weight of the available water inthe dispenser and pops an alert when the water in the dispenser is about to finish. It measures the
water level and pushes notifications to the user about water consumption.Municipal Corporation Water Distribution System is manual and has no system to monitor the consumption of water.
Each individual have their own capacity for usage of waterbut everyone have to pay same amount for their consumption. And if any person fails to paywater bill then there is no such system 
which can restrict the water supply to their houses. Thereis no system that can monitor the flow of water and consumption of water. The “Prepaid andPostpaid Water Distribution Controller” 
been developed to override the problems prevailing inthe existing manual system. This system is designed for the municipal corporations to carry outdrinking water operation in smooth and effective manner. 
Water Distribution Controller is thesystem which can control the usage of water according to the bill payment by the user.

         Water is one of the most precious and irreplaceable natural resources available on earth. It needs to be managed carefully and efficiently, to be preserved for the coming generations.
distribution system consists of A water different elements like pipes, valves, pumps and tanks. The pipeline arrangement helps to convey water from the source to the individual house. Designing and operating a
water distribution system is the most important consideration for a lifetime of expected loading conditions. Furthermore, a water distribution system must be able to assist the abnormal conditions
such as pipe breakage, mechanical failure of pipes, valves, and control systems, power outages and inaccurate demand projections. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has made a great impact in today’s
world. The idea of connecting everything wirelessly made the thing easier. We can connect anything using the sensors designed specifically for objects. IoT is the network of objects, devices embedded
with electronic sensors, and connectivity to enable them to talk to each other and execute functions.The devices participating in IoT must be designed in such a way that it should be interoperable with
different embedded controllers as well as with different wireless technologies. IoT is progressing with millions of things connecting each day to generate large amount of information resulting in useful
future actions. This work focuses on a solution for Water distribution and management in urban and rural areas with the help of IoT. Water should be conserved and the supply needs to be regulated.
Water demand is exponentially growing high with the increase in population. To maintain the supply demand ration proper, it is important to have systems to prevent excess usage of water and to reduce
the wastage of water. Hence an IoT system is designed with we can monitor the usage of water according to the availability. A smart water management is a two-way real-time network that consists
sensors and devices that continually and remotely monitor the water distribution system. Sensors placed in the tank gives the water level at the current time.
